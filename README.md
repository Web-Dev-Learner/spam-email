This project aims to automatically classify emails as either spam or ham (non-spam) using machine learning techniques. The dataset used consists of labeled emails that are processed and used to train models to distinguish spam from legitimate emails. The project showcases data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment for email classification.

## What Iâ€™ve Done

### 1. **Data Collection**
   - Downloaded the **Spam-Ham Dataset** from a reliable source.
   - The dataset contains labeled emails with two classes: Spam and Ham.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Loaded and explored the dataset using **Pandas**.
   - Cleaned the dataset by removing unnecessary columns and handling any missing data.
   - Balanced the dataset to ensure equal representation of both classes (Spam and Ham).
   - Applied **Text Preprocessing**:
     - Tokenized the email content.
     - Removed stopwords, punctuation, and performed stemming/lemmatization.
     - Used **TF-IDF Vectorizer** to convert text data into numerical format for model input.

### 3. **Model Selection & Training**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Trained multiple machine learning models, including:
     - **Logistic Regression**
     - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
   - Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

### 4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Used **cross-validation** to evaluate the model performance.
   - Achieved high performance with an accuracy of **98.17%** on the test set and a test loss of **0.08**.
   - Visualized model evaluation metrics using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

### 5. **Deployment**
   - Added the model to a **Jupyter Notebook** for easy reproducibility and sharing.
   - Created an environment with necessary dependencies.
   - Pushed the project to **GitHub** for version control and public sharing.

## Features

- **Spam vs. Ham Classification**: Classifies emails into spam or ham categories.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes data cleaning, text processing, and vectorization.
